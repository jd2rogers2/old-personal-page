      <h3>Ruby Gem Filetree Setup</h3>

      <p>As I started to learn scraping, I actually found one of the hardest things to be the project set up. Requiring different things in different files, shell scripts, shebang statements, and all the other files that support your code but aren't widely talked about online. </p>

      <p>After searching the web, I found no filetrees that also had descriptions of what the file did and what content to include. So I thought I would build a list of everything that goes in your root directory for a ruby project. I hope you like it.</p>

      <p>A quick note for those who have a similar skill level as I do now: you may be wondering about shell scripts and requiring gems/files, I have listed some additional links at the end of this blog for you.</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="indent_0">root directory - holds all files and folders (folders end in a backslash below)</li>
          <li class="indent_1">bin/ - this folder generally only holds executable files</li>
            <li class="indent_2">runner - sometimes also named after the project</li>
              <li class="indent_3">this is where you actually call the classes/methods to run your program</li>
              <li class="indent_3">make sure to include require “environment”</li>
            <li class="indent_2">console - this file is used to peak inside your program, along with test variables and such, using IRB</li>
              <li class="indent_3">at the top make sure to have a shebang statement that will load your program in ruby, usually looks something like #!/usr/bin/env ruby</li>
              <li class="indent_3">should require bundler/setup, IRB, and the file where your ruby code is. at the end call IRB.start</li>
            <li class="indent_2">setup - this file houses code that define settings that your program will abide by</li>
              <li class="indent_3">so if it is a cli program we would start with #!/bin/bash</li>
              <li class="indent_3">other commonly included things are set -euo pipefail and IFS=$'\n\t'</li>
              <li class="indent_3">more on these below in resources but the first specifies error settings, and the second, line break settings (IFS stands for internal field separator)</li>
              <li class="indent_3">another best practice is to include bundle install in this file</li>
          <li class="indent_1">config/ - conventionally only has your environment file</li>
            <li class="indent_2">environment.rb</li>
              <li class="indent_3">here is where you require all gems and files needed for the runner, this way you can just require environment in your runner. separation of duties</li>
              <li class="indent_3">should require lib and all necessary gems</li>
          <li class="indent_1">lib/ - basically everything internal goes here: modules, classes, and methods</li>
            <li class="indent_2">example.rb</li>
          <li class="indent_1">spec/ - holds all tests</li>
            <li class="indent_2">example_test.rb</li>
          <li class="indent_1">data/ - houses anything else needed for the project i.e. media</li>
          <li class="indent_1">gemfile - here is where your project actually loads all necessary gems, so list all of them in the gem "name" format</li>
          <li class="indent_1">gemfile.lock - when you bundle gem and rspec init from the command line, before starting any work on your project, this and the gemfile will be added automatically. this file is locked</li>
          <li class="indent_1">readme.md - an explanation of what your program is used for and how to use it</li>
          <li class="indent_1">license.md - copyright mumbo jumbo</li>
            <li class="indent_2">it is conventional to borrow a stock license provided by github</li>
          <li class="indent_1">rakefile - think of this as the runner file for your tests</li>
          <li class="indent_1">contributing.md - info on editing open source software, such as format and test fixes</li>
          <li class="indent_1">.gitignore - tells git which files to ignore during commits, github has samples you can borrow</li>
          <li class="indent_1">.rspec</li>
          <li class="indent_1">root.gemspec</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Boss is a Jerk - pt.1</h3>

      <p class="disclosure">Disclosure, please read My Boss is a Jerk - series intro first.</p>

      <p>He’s never happy. It’s like he’s watching over my shoulder and knows my exact productivity and precisely how much time I've spent in the office.</p>

      <p>The day’s objectives are just so undefined; whether he feels satisfied with the amount of work I get done or not, is completely arbitrary. If I spend even 15 minutes less than a normal eight hour day in the office, then he stresses out and I can just tell that it nags him for the entire evening. He always makes these unnecessary remarks just as I’m leaving the office for the day. How is that supposed to motivate me?</p>

      <p>He’s never happy. #MyBossisaJerk</p>

      <h3>My Boss is a Jerk - series intro</h3>

      <p>Welcome to the ‘My Boss is a Jerk’ series. I will be chronicling my exploits of self employment and working from home.</p>

      <p>To be honest I’m not self employed yet, but hope to be (at least partially with my own side project) in about three months time. I am taking a self-paced online webdev class until then; so there will be similarities as I motivate myself and manage my own time.</p>

      <h3>Why did I decide to learn software development?</h3>

      <p>In short... because I tried some other things and enjoyed this the most I wasn’t being challenged at my last position, so I decided to start figuring out what I wanted to do.</p>

      <p>It starts when I picked the wrong major and the wrong school and breezed through college with minimal effort. Then I finally got a job in real estate but wasn’t being challenged. I dipped my feet in a lot of different areas such as GRE studies, series 7 studies, building a PC, and ended up really enjoying the PC.</p>

      <p>After lots of research on how each component works, I finally felt like I had a good idea of what I wanted to buy. Then a day or two of tinkering, maybe I had to buy one more component I can’t remember, and then downloading Linux; and I was done! It’s a really cool experience, using a computer that you built. Naturally I wanted to continue, so I poked around on some MOOC Java classes and CodeAcademy and what not. After a while of that, it was time to take the plunge, so I started researching full time classes.</p>

      <p>Obviously a big part of my decision was the return on investment. I’d get to be a part of an industry with massive growth and that is the cool thing right now; the salary bump wasn’t bad either, and all for a minimal investment.</p>

      <p>I had been saving for at least a year already, since I knew I was going to be making a career change. So a little sacrifice there in the form of reduced spending, mixed with the opportunity cost of no income for 3-6 months, tuition, and (again) 3-6 months of hard work; but that’s it, that’s really all of the expenses.</p>

      <p>Flatiron was a no brainer. No other bootcamps have released jobs reports or offer tuition reimbursement, and the price for the online Learn Verified program can’t be beaten.</p>
