      <h3>Learning sql just takes persistence</h3>

      <p>At first, sql was an easy language to pick up. It was pretty basic, just creating tables, inserting into them, selecting from them, altering them… Things were great, now my programs could persist data. Then it was time to starting joining and all of the sudden things were not great, things were bad. I spent the next two to three hours very frustrated that I couldn’t grasp this concept.</p>

      <p>After reading practically every stack exchange question on sqlite joining I figured out a way to understand it that works for me. Looking back it seems easy now but it just didn’t click until I thought of the statement with a new comma placement. At first I was reading:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li class="select_statement">SELECT * FROM table1, </li>
        <li class="select_statement">INNER JOIN table2, </li>
        <li class="select_statement">ON table1_column = table2_column;</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Then I started to realize that it helps to read it like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="select_statement">SELECT * ,</li> 
        <li class="select_statement">FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2, </li>
        <li class="select_statement">ON table1_column = table2_column;</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So now things were great again, we even started learning how to link our sql database with our ruby code. This was really neat until we started to build abstract and dynamic super classes that would work (build tables and such) for any child class. Things were again bad.</p>

      <p>The trouble I was having this time was with interpolating method names into the sql string. Sometimes I found I could just interpolate in the standard fashion, other times I found I would need to interpolate and put it in "quotes" and ‘single quotes’, or any combination of the three. My friends, I wish I could tell you I figured this one out but alas this is why I say learning sql just takes persistence.</p>

      <h3>Finishing my first gem</h3>

      <p>I literally just finished my first gem and it is a really awesome feeling. I coded a program that can output the weather for any zip code in the US. It can also tell you some weather information for the coming days. It scrapes from weather.gov.</p>

      <p>The best part actually came on Friday (three days ago), when I finished writing the command line portion of the program so that you can actually experience what it does. When I could type in any zip code I wanted and it would output the town/city’s name, I was a little impressed with myself. When you type in the zip it interpolates that into the url and then scrapes from that weather.gov url. It takes the weather and temp (among other things) from that url; this was the first program I had written by myself that had a massive amount of outputs, and I hadn’t even defined the outputs.</p>

      <p>The next feeling of accomplishment came today when I put the finishing touches on and wrote this blog. Looking back over the past year, I’ve come a long way from just knowing basic html/css, to building my own computer, to starting slowly on codeacademy, to jumping all in and applying to The Flatiron School.</p>

      <h3>Ruby Gem Filetree Setup</h3>

      <p>As I started to learn scraping, I actually found one of the hardest things to be the project set up and packaging the project as a gem. Requiring different things in different files, shell scripts, shebang statements, and all the other files that support your code but aren't widely talked about online. </p>

      <p>After searching the web, I found no filetrees that also had descriptions of what the file did and what content to include. So I thought I would build a list of everything that goes in your root directory for a ruby project. I hope you like it.</p>

      <p>A quick note for those who have a similar skill level as I do now: you may be wondering about shell scripts and requiring gems/files, I have listed some additional links at the end of this blog for you.</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="indent_0">root directory - holds all files and folders (folders end in a backslash below)</li>
          <li class="indent_1">bin/ - this folder generally only holds executable files (make files executable by running chmod in your command line, ls -l should then show x's if successful</li>
            <li class="indent_2">runner - sometimes also named after the project</li>
              <li class="indent_3">this is where you actually call the classes/methods to run your program</li>
              <li class="indent_3">make sure to include require “environment”</li>
            <li class="indent_2">console - this file is used to peak inside your program, along with test variables and such, using IRB</li>
              <li class="indent_3">at the top make sure to have a shebang statement that will load your program in ruby, usually looks something like #!/usr/bin/env ruby</li>
              <li class="indent_3">should require bundler/setup, IRB, and the file where your ruby code is. at the end call IRB.start</li>
            <li class="indent_2">setup - this file houses code that define settings that your program will abide by</li>
              <li class="indent_3">so if it is a cli program we would start with #!/bin/bash</li>
              <li class="indent_3">other commonly included things are set -euo pipefail and IFS=$'\n\t'</li>
              <li class="indent_3">more on these below in resources but the first specifies error settings, and the second, line break settings (IFS stands for internal field separator)</li>
              <li class="indent_3">another best practice is to include bundle install in this file</li>
          <li class="indent_1">config/ - conventionally only has your environment file</li>
            <li class="indent_2">environment.rb</li>
              <li class="indent_3">here is where you require all gems and files needed for the runner, this way you can just require environment in your runner. separation of duties</li>
              <li class="indent_3">should require lib and all necessary gems</li>
          <li class="indent_1">lib/ - basically everything internal goes here: modules, classes, and methods</li>
            <li class="indent_2">example.rb</li>
          <li class="indent_1">spec/ - holds all tests</li>
            <li class="indent_2">example_test.rb</li>
          <li class="indent_1">data/ - houses anything else needed for the project i.e. media</li>
          <li class="indent_1">gemfile - here is where your project actually loads all necessary gems, so list all of them in the gem "name" format</li>
          <li class="indent_1">gemfile.lock - when you bundle gem and rspec init from the command line, before starting any work on your project, this and the gemfile will be added automatically. this file is locked</li>
          <li class="indent_1">readme.md - an explanation of what your program is used for and how to use it</li>
          <li class="indent_1">license.md - copyright mumbo jumbo</li>
            <li class="indent_2">it is conventional to borrow a stock license provided by github</li>
          <li class="indent_1">rakefile - think of this as the runner file for your tests</li>
          <li class="indent_1">contributing.md - info on editing open source software, such as format and test fixes</li>
          <li class="indent_1">.gitignore - tells git which files to ignore during commits, github has samples you can borrow</li>
          <li class="indent_1">.rspec</li>
          <li class="indent_1">root.gemspec</li>
          <li class="indent_2">here you list attributes about your gem</li>
          <li class="indent_3">make sure to list all your files using `git ls-files`.split($\)</li>
          <li class="indent_3">also make sure to list just your runner file as an executable</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why did I decide to learn software development?</h3>

      <p>In short... because I tried some other things and enjoyed this the most I wasn’t being challenged at my last position, so I decided to start figuring out what I wanted to do.</p>

      <p>It starts when I picked the wrong major and the wrong school and breezed through college with minimal effort. Then I finally got a job in real estate but wasn’t being challenged. I dipped my feet in a lot of different areas such as GRE studies, series 7 studies, building a PC, and ended up really enjoying the PC.</p>

      <p>After lots of research on how each component works, I finally felt like I had a good idea of what I wanted to buy. Then a day or two of tinkering, maybe I had to buy one more component I can’t remember, and then downloading Linux; and I was done! It’s a really cool experience, using a computer that you built. Naturally I wanted to continue, so I poked around on some MOOC Java classes and CodeAcademy and what not. After a while of that, it was time to take the plunge, so I started researching full time classes.</p>

      <p>Obviously a big part of my decision was the return on investment. I’d get to be a part of an industry with massive growth and that is the cool thing right now; the salary bump wasn’t bad either, and all for a minimal investment.</p>

      <p>I had been saving for at least a year already, since I knew I was going to be making a career change. So a little sacrifice there in the form of reduced spending, mixed with the opportunity cost of no income for 3-6 months, tuition, and (again) 3-6 months of hard work; but that’s it, that’s really all of the expenses.</p>

      <p>Flatiron was a no brainer. No other bootcamps have released jobs reports or offer tuition reimbursement, and the price for the online Learn Verified program can’t be beaten.</p>
