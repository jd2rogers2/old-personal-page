      <h3>My Boss is a Jerk - pt.1</h3>

      <p>He’s never happy. It’s like he’s watching over my shoulder and knows my exact productivity and precisely how much time I've spent in the office.</p>

      <p>The day’s objectives are just so undefined; whether he feels satisfied with the amount of work I get done or not, is completely arbitrary. If I spend even 15 minutes less than a normal eight hour day in the office, then he stresses out and I can just tell that it nags him for the entire evening. He always makes these unnecessary remarks just as I’m leaving the office for the day. How is that supposed to motivate me?</p>

      <p>He’s never happy. #MyBossisaJerk</p>

      <h3>My Boss is a Jerk - series intro</h3>

      <p>Welcome to the ‘My Boss is a Jerk’ series. I will be chronicling my exploits of self employment and working from home.</p>

      <p>To be honest I’m not self employed yet, but hope to be (at least partially with my own side project) in about three months time. I am taking a self-paced online webdev class until then; so there will be similarities as I motivate myself and manage my own time.</p>

      <h3>Why did I decide to learn software development?</h3>

      <p>In short... because I wasn’t being challenged at my last position, so I decided to start figuring out what I wanted to do.</p>

      <p>It starts when I picked the wrong major and the wrong school and breezed through college with minimal effort. Then I finally got a job in real estate but, as I said, wasn’t being challenged. I dipped my feet in a lot of different areas such as GRE studies, series 7 studies, building a PC, and ended up really enjoying the PC.</p>

      <p>After lots of research on how each component works, I finally felt like I had a good idea of what I wanted to buy. Then a day or two of tinkering, maybe I had to buy one more component I can’t remember, and then downloading Linux; and I was done! It’s a really cool experience, using a computer that you built. Naturally I wanted to continue, so I poked around on some MOOC Java classes and CodeAcademy and what not. After a while of that, it was time to take the plunge, so I started researching full time classes.</p>

      <p>Obviously a big part of my decision was the return on investment. I’d get to be a part of an industry with massive growth and that is the cool thing right now; the salary bump wasn’t bad either, and all for a minimal investment.</p>

      <p>I had been saving for at least a year already, since I knew I was going to be making a career change. So a little sacrifice there in the form of reduced spending, mixed with the opportunity cost of no income for 3-6 months, tuition, and (again) 3-6 months of hard work; but that’s it, that’s really all of the expenses.</p>

      <p>Flatiron was a no brainer. No other bootcamps have released jobs reports or offer tuition reimbursement, and the price for the online Learn Verified program can’t be beaten.</p>
